TODO :D 

redo item interface with pyqt5-tools designer
- create the main item interface that:
     displays a list of item names in alphabetical order by default, option to filter based on different item properties, and 
     a search bar that searches the table in order of priority Name, type, and key words in any special properties or description documents. include a ? option to select why an item appears in a search result.

     Has a + icon at the bottom right which guides the user through an item creation screen

- create the item creation screen 
     With structure based on the flow chart in my microsoft whiteboard.
     Each node of user input can get stored as another row in the current active database file.
